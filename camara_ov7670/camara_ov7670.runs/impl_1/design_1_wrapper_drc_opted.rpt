BIVC-1#1 Error
Bank IO standard Vcc  - IOBank:34
Conflicting Vcc voltages in bank 34. For example, the following two ports in this bank have conflicting VCCOs:  
vga_green_0[1] (LVCMOS18, requiring VCCO=1.800) and pclk_0 (LVCMOS33, requiring VCCO=3.300)
Related violations: <none>

BIVC-1#2 Error
Bank IO standard Vcc  - IOBank:35
Conflicting Vcc voltages in bank 35. For example, the following two ports in this bank have conflicting VCCOs:  
vga_green_0[2] (LVCMOS18, requiring VCCO=1.800) and vga_green_0[0] (LVCMOS33, requiring VCCO=3.300)
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .xdc file to demote this message to a WARNING. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged. These examples can be used directly in the .xdc file to override this clock rule.
	< set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets pclk_0_IBUF] >

	pclk_0_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to W15
	pclk_0_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) cannot be placed

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
10 out of 167 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: vga_green_0[3], vga_green_0[1], d_0[7:0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
8 out of 167 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: d_0[7:0].
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port siod_0 expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
